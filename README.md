# CS3050-Final-Project
Final Project Repository for CS3050A (Software Engineering)

Group Members: Nathaniel Borrok-Hoffman, Reuben Trachtenberg, Andrew Libby, Steven De Jesus 

Proposal: 

	Our team plans to make the game of Clue for our final project. Our program will stay true to the rules and functionality of the boardgame. The object of the game is to guess which character is the killer, with what weapon they did the killing, and in what room did they do it. There will be dice rolls for movement, some sort of inventory system, and an interface for players to communicate their guesses in between each round.  

Components: 

Graphics 

Game board 

Playable characters 

Rooms on the game board

Frameworks:

Languages:

Maybe JavaScript if we put it online
